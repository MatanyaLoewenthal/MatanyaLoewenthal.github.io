# Who am I?

I'm a Senior Computer Science Major at the University of Maryland, College Park. I specialize in lower level programming (think Operating Systems, Compilers, `C`, and `x86`), but I'm at home in everything from Object Oriented Programming with `Python` and `Java` to Functional Languages like `Ocaml` and `Racket`.

My primary Operating System and devopment environment for the last 8 years has been `Linux`, specifically `Debian` based distrobutions, but I have significant experience with most `UNIX` based systems from the past 10 years.
